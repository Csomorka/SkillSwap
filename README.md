# SkillSwap

SkillSwap is a platform where users can exchange knowledge and skills with each other.  
For example, someone might offer violin lessons in exchange for help with web development.

## Features

- User authentication (sign up, log in)
- Post feed for skill exchange
- Real-time 1-on-1 messaging
- View other users' profiles
- Update your own profile (bio, profile picture, password, skills)
- Create and delete your own posts
- Ratings and reviews between users

## Tech Stack

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase
- Vite
- Context API
- React Query

## Current Status

- The core functionality is mostly complete and working.
- Styling and design are still a work in progress and may not be polished.
- Error handling needs improvement; alerts will be replaced with better notifications (e.g., hot toast).
- The ratings feature is planned but not yet implemented.
- There is a minor issue with the websocket connection that needs fixing.

This project is actively being developed and improved.
